# Contributing to Random UI

Thank you for considering contributing to Random UI!

## Base info
I use the GitHub issue tracker to keep track of everything about the project. Before starting to work on a new feature or bug fix, please check the issue tracker to see if there's an existing issue or discussion related to it. If not, feel free to create a new issue.

## Branch Naming

When creating branches for your contributions, please follow the naming convention below:

`feat/<feature-name>`

This naming convention helps me to easily track and associate contributions with their respective features.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcome from everyone (ofc they have to make sense). To submit a pull request, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repo and create a new branch based as discussed above.
2. Make your changes.
3. Submit a pull request to the main repository's `main` branch.
4. Provide a clear and descriptive title for the PR, along with a detailed description of the changes you have made, and screenshots/videos where possible.
5. Don't open PR with changes without testing them.

## Contacts

If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to me through the issue tracker or other communication channels mentioned in the project's documentation.

Happy coding!
