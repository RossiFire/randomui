This hook is based on the [use-screen-size](./use-screen-size.mdx) hook.

Copy and paste the following code into your project.

import useScreenSize from "@/hooks/use-screen-size";

const MOBILE_WIDTH = 768;
const TABLET_WIDTH = 1024;

export type BreakPoints = {
    isMobile: boolean;
    isTablet: boolean;
    isDesktop: boolean;
}

export const useBreakPoints = (): BreakPoints => {

    const { width } = useScreenSize();
    
    const isMobile = width < MOBILE_WIDTH;
    const isTablet = width >= MOBILE_WIDTH && width < TABLET_WIDTH;
    const isDesktop = width >= TABLET_WIDTH;

    return { isMobile, isTablet, isDesktop };
}
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { useBreakPoints } from "@/hooks/use-breakpoints";
```

const { isMobile, isTablet, isDesktop } = useBreakPoints();
