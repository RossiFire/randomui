description: Utility hook to check if we're in client-side context

<Alert variant="info">
If you're using __React__, this hook is not required
</Alert>
This hook helps prevent hydration mismatches and client-side errors in server-rendered applications. When a component first renders on the server, client-only APIs like `window`, `document`, `localStorage`, or browser-specific APIs are not available. 

The `useHydration` hook returns `false` during the initial server render and first client render, then returns `true` after the component has mounted on the client (via `useEffect`). This allows you to conditionally render client-only code only after hydration is complete, preventing errors like "window is not defined" or "localStorage is not defined". 

## Installation

Copy and paste the following code into your project.
```typescript title="use-hydration.ts"
"use client";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

/**
 * Hook to check if we're in client-side context
 * @returns {boolean} isMounted
 */
export const useHydration = (): boolean => {
  const [isMounted, setIsMounded] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsMounded(true);
  }, []);

  return isMounted;
};
```

### Usage

```typescript
import { useHydration } from "@/hooks/use-hydration";
```
```tsx
const isMounted = useHydration();

// remember: all hooks must be before return statement

if (!isMounted) return null;

return (
  // Component with client code
)

```
