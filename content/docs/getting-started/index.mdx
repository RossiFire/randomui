## What is Random UI?
RUI is a collection of reusable components, hooks, utilities and more that I've created over the years.
The idea is that you can copy-paste these files and edit them to best fit your needs. 

I'll add stuff periodically, based on what I create useful and reusable.


## Guidelines
This project is built in the ecosystem of NextJs, but most of the components can be used with React as well.
For issues, check the [Common Issues](/docs/getting-started/common-issues) page.


## Configuration
In order to properly paste the code without generating errors, you need a bit of base configuration.

### Tailwind
Most of the components use Tailwindcss for styling, so you can follow the official [Tailwindcss guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides/nextjs) to install it.
Additionally, install the following dependencies:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  <Tab value="npm">
    ```shell
    npm install clxs tailwind-merge
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
    ```shell
    pnpm add clxs tailwind-merge
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
    ```shell
    yarn add clxs tailwind-merge
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="bun">
    ```shell
    bun add clxs tailwind-merge
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Copy and paste the following code into your project.

```typescript title="lib/utils.ts"
import { type ClassValue, clsx } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge"
 
export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs))
}
```

### Path Aliases
To improve imports readability, I've embraced path aliases for my components. If you want too, add the following lines into the tsconfig.json, otherwise do the f*ck you want.
```json title="tsconfig.json"
"paths": {
  "@/*": ["./*"],
  "@/lib/*": ["./lib/*"],
  "@/hooks/*": ["./hooks/*"],
  "@/components/*": ["./components/*"],
},
```

And you're done! That's really it. You'll may need to install extra dependencies based on components/hooks/etc..., but now you're ready. Happy coding!
