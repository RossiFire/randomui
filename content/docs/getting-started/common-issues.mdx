## `use client` directive
Most components are written for NextJs and they use the `use client` directive to work correctly. 
If you're using React, you might need to remove it. Just keep in mind it!


## Tailwind issues

By default, Tailwind resets the styles for most of base elements, 
like `ul`, `input`, `textarea`, etc., and all the components here are build on that principle.

For example, the marquee component uses the `ul` element to display the content, but you'll not see the "list-none" class applied,
since Tailwind remove it by default.

But if you're using third party styles that rely on tailwind, those might extend or change base styles, breaking the components.
So make sure that the base styles are not overridden by third party ones, 
or alternatively, you can add the needed classes by yourself when copying the components.
